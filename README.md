# AIDI 1002 Final Project: Liver Disease Diagnosis Using Machine Learning

## Setup

1. **Python Installation**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. **Library Installation**: Install required libraries using `pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost seaborn matplotlib`.

## Data Preparation

- Place the liver disease dataset (presumably 'cirrhosis.csv') in the project directory.

## Running the Code

1. **Open the Notebook**: Open 'AIDI_1002_Final_Project_Ajiharan_Kanthasamy_And_Nelson_Ojeaburu.ipynb' in Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Run Cells**: Execute each cell in sequence, from importing libraries to running machine learning models.

## Output

- The notebook will display the performance of different models and their effectiveness in diagnosing liver disease.
